    	<figcaption style="font-size: medium">Fig. 3 - Full extent of Hubble ACS/WFC coverage of the JWST NEP TDF. Regions of overlap between visits in the mosaic are highlighted in progressively darker shades of grey for areas of 2-, 3-, and 4-epoch overlap. This paper focuses on these regions of overlap, with a total area of 87.94 arcmin<sub>2</sub>, to investigate transients and variable sources. Red circles mark the positions of the 12 identified transients, while blue squares and diamonds mark the 190 unique variable candidates discovered in this study. Symbol shapes and colors identify the samples from which individual variables were selected, as indicated by the legend at the top of the figure. For comparison, the JWST/NIRCam coverage of this field is outlined in orange.</figcaption>
